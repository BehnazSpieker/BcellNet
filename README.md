# BcellNet
Tool for network-based analysis of B-cell clonal expansion


# Project aims and goals:
1. Learn the process of B-cell development
2. Learn how to handle massive high throughput sequencing (HTSeq) data with R
3. Create a tool for network-based analysis of clonal expansion

# At the end of the project (to be announced, but somewhere in February) you would need to:
1. Present the results of your work
2. Hand in a concise documentation on your work/tool
