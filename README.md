# BcellNet
Tool for network-based analysis of B-cell clonal expansion


# Project goals:
1. Learn the process of B-cell development
2. Learn how to handle massive high throughput sequencing (HTSeq) data with R
3. Create a tool for network-based analysis of clonal expansion

# At the end of the project (somewhere in February) you need to:
1. Present the results of the work
2. Hand in a documentation on the work/tool
